## Introduction
This repository demonstrates real-time hand gesture recognition using the MediaPipe library and volume control using the `pycaw` library. It captures live video from your computer's webcam and recognizes specific hand gestures to adjust the system's audio volume.

## Features
- **Hand Gesture Recognition:** The code uses the MediaPipe library to detect and recognize hand gestures in real-time video frames.
- **Volume Control:** The project controls the system's audio volume based on the detected hand gesture. Hand gestures include actions like changing the volume, muting, and unmuting.
- **Interactive Visual Feedback:** The code provides real-time visual feedback by displaying the detected hand landmarks, hand gestures, and the current volume level on the screen.
- **Gesture Thresholds:** The system uses predefined gesture thresholds to determine the action to perform (e.g., increase volume, decrease volume, mute).

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the Python script in your preferred environment.
3. Use your hand gestures in front of the webcam to control the audio volume.
4. Press 'Q' to exit the application.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-gesture-volume-control.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd hand-gesture-volume-control
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```sh
   python hand_gesture_volume_control.py
   ```

## Example
1. Run the `hand_gesture_volume_control.py` script.
2. Use hand gestures in front of your webcam to control the audio volume, including increasing, decreasing, muting, and unmuting.
3. Press 'Q' to exit the application.
